# Project Summary 
DBpedia is a collaborative initiative focused on extracting structured information from Wikipedia and presenting it as Linked Open Data. While semantic web resourceful languages like English and German have dedicated DBpedia chapters, there is a need for more representation of low-resourced languages like Amharic. 

This project endeavors to create an Amharic DBpedia Chapter, aiming to be the first sub-Saharan African language to join the internationalization efforts of DBpedia. Our goal is to extend the existing extractor framework for Amharic to allow knowledge graph extraction from Amharic Wikipedia. We will make the extracted knowledge graph queryable and available to end users via a web page .
